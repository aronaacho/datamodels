Microsoft Access is a commercial database with a relational data model. Just like other SQL databases, the relational datamodel organizes data through rows and columns, with information being interpreted through the intersections of the tableâ€™s rows and columns. There are various hosting models including the Cloud, embedded, and the client/server (with other Microsoft products) model. Java and Python can access the Microsoft Access databases using JDBCs (Java Database Connectivity) for MS Access and a Python database adapters for MS Access, such as Pyodbc.
