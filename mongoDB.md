MongoDB is an open-source database management system with a NoSQL document-oriented data model. This model’s schema is allows for data to be grouped by document, and referenced by other documents through similar data (such as documents with the same ID number can be linked). The hosting model is a networked model, where the databases can be connected to through a Cloud, however the MongoDBs can also be saved on local devices before they are pushed into the network, therefore also supporting the local, embedded, and client/server hosting model.  This DBMS allows for Java and Python access through MongoDB’s Atlas cluster driver, allowing support for both languages to reach the MongoDBs.
