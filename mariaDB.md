___
MariaDB is an open-source database management system with a relational data model. Just like other SQL databases, the relational datamodel organizes data through rows and columns, with information being interpreted through the intersections of the table’s rows and columns. This RDBMS can be hosted through the various hosting models including the client/server, local, embedded, and Cloud. As the creators of MariaDB are also the MySQL developers, the mySQL client and MariaDB are made to be highly adaptable. Java can access the databases with MariaDB Connector/J, a JDBC driver made specifically for MariaDB and MySQL databases. Python can have access to the databases through the MySQL Python Package which contains a Python connector to MariaDB.
