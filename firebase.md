Firebase is a commercial database management system with a NoSQL JSON tree data model. The data is stored as JSON objects and organized into one tree, therefore Firebase recommends for the data structures to be flattened as possible rather than continuously unnecessarily nesting the data. Firebase offers various hosting models including the client/server, local, embedded, and Cloud, which is optimized by the Firebase RealTime Database. Java and Python can have access to the Firebase databases through the SDKs that bundle the Google Cloud client libraries for various language accessibilities.
