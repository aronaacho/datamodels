Apache Cassandra is an open-source database with a NoSQL partitioned row storage data model. Similarly to the relational model, it utilizes the organizational qualities of columns. It differs from the relational model as the columnar model is expanded on in a linear fashion rather than through additional rows. The hosting model is through a networked, decentralized model, and therefore allowing it to be hosted with a Cloud and also a client/server model. It also maintains their data persistence by initially sending the data through local files to be later sent to various nodes. Java and Python can access the Cassandra databases through respective drivers, such as the DataStax Python driver and Java can be accessed through the Java client which is already written in Cassandra.
