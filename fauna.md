Fauna is an open-commercial database management system with a NoSQL document-oriented data model. This modelâ€™s scheme allows for data to be grouped by documents, and referenced by other documents through the unique document ID. Each document can have multiple entities, creating nested data, however Fauna advices against unnecessarily long documents with highly nested data. The hosting model is marketed as a networked model, as Fauna claims to be a serverless cloud database. However, it can also be used for local development, embedded, and local hosting as well. Java and Python can have accessibility through their respective drivers as presented by Fauna.
