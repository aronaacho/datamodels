____
PostgreSQL is an open-source database management system with a relational data model. Just like other SQL databases, the relational datamodel organizes data through rows and columns, with information being interpreted through the intersections of the tableâ€™s rows and columns. This RDBMS can be hosted through the client/server, local, embedded, and through the Cloud using other cloud providers like Amazon AWS or Google Cloud. Java can access their databases through the PostgreSQL JDBC driver. Python can have access to their databases through third-party adapters like psycopg.
