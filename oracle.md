Oracle is a commercial database management system with a relational data model. Just like other SQL databases, the relational datamodel organizes data through rows and columns, with information being interpreted through the intersections of the table’s rows and columns. With this RDBMS, other Oracle products can be used to smoothly integrate the database to various hosting methods. It is marketed to use a network model through the Cloud, and products such as the Oracle Client allow for a local, embedded, and client/server hosting model as well. These databases are Python-accessible through python_oracledb, a driver that allows for access of the databases from Pythom programs. Similarly, the databases can be accessed by Java through the installment of Oracle’s Java package Oracle JVM (DBMS_JAVA).
